# Env-KB65M
 A 65% Custom Mechanical Keyboard.


### About
Like all my other Keyboard designs this uses a Raspberry Pi Pico however this is a 65%, it has most of the same keys as the main part of a TKL but squashed in just a bit.

this also features a 3-split spacebar that can be ignored and just be used as a single 6.25U spacebar.
