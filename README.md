### About
Like all my other Keyboard designs this uses a Raspberry Pi Pico however this is a 65%, it has most of the same keys as the main part of a TKL but squashed in just a bit.
This features a 3 split spacebar which instead can fit a single 6.25u, there are also 4 spare GPIOs, you can run one I2C device off of or 3 analogue devices.

This does have mechboards logos on it as I made this on a whim based on something David from mechboards said.
