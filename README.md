 A 65% Custom Mechanical Keyboard.
 
 Project Name: KB65M
 Nickname: Janus
  
### About
Like all my other Keyboard designs this uses a Raspberry Pi Pico however this is a 65%, it has most of the same keys as the main part of a TKL but squashed in just a bit.

this also features a 3-split spacebar that can be ignored and just be used as a single 6.25U spacebar.

This does have mechboards logos on it as I made this on a whim based on something David from mechboards said.
